# Clap Switch PCB Project

## Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of a Clap Switch PCB using Proteus 8 Professional software. The Clap Switch allows devices to be turned on or off with a simple clap, demonstrating the practical application of sound sensors in controlling electronics.

## Features
- **Sound Activation**: Uses a microphone to detect claps.
- **Toggle Functionality**: Turns devices on or off with each clap detected.
- **Compact Design**: Efficient PCB layout to ensure reliable performance.
- **Easy Integration**: Can be integrated with various electronic devices.

## Project Details
### Software Used
- **Proteus 8 Professional**: For designing the PCB layout and simulating the circuit.

### Components
- **Microphone**: To capture the sound of claps.
- **Operational Amplifier (Op-Amp)**: To amplify the microphone signal.
- **Transistor**: To act as a switch for controlling the output device.
- **Resistors, Capacitors, and Diodes**: For circuit stability and functionality.
- **PCB**: Custom-designed using Proteus 8 Professional.

### How It Works
1. The microphone captures the sound of a clap and converts it into an electrical signal.
2. The signal is amplified using an operational amplifier.
3. The amplified signal is processed to detect a valid clap.
4. Upon detecting a clap, the transistor toggles the state of the output device, turning it on or off.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Proteus 8 Professional software installed.
